    Overall, this project was a moderate success. I would have liked to get the multiplayer working (I should have come to you sooner)
but I think the gameplay is a good base that could blossom into a great game with more time and content.

    I struggled a lot with arrays, objects and classes. I had a habit of getting things to come back undefined and break my code.
This was solved by developing my skills of closely reading my code and using console logging to diagnose problems.

    I had to learn how to get classes to work during this project, and I ran into several interesting problems like trying to use this.
and learning that this. occasionally refers to the window instead of the instance of the class I'm working on. Also defining classes in
a function only works some of the time.

    Things generally just broke a lot and didn't work as easily as I wanted them to, but I got through them mostly through brute force
and console logging until I isolated the problem.
